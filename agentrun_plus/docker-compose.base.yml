# Base Docker Compose configuration for AgentRun
# This file contains common configuration shared across all environments
# Use with environment-specific override files
#
# This project allows a user the ability to execute Python code safely in a
# remote Docker container using a REST API. The overall service is broken down
# into two parts each running in its own container as a way of providing
# additional isolation between API handling and executing Python code.
#
# - `api`: Handles REST API requests from the user and manages user sessions.
#   In addition to allowing a user to run arbitrary Python code, it also allows
#   user to provide context in terms of additional files (ex: SQL databases, CSV
#   files, etc.,) to be passed and stored in the sandbox volume that is shared
#   and reserved for execution.
# - `python-runner` - The sandbox in which the Python code passed through the
#   REST API runs.
#
